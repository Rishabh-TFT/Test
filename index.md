    Introduced in Github (Tier) X.Y (2).

The introduction should answer the following questions:

    What is this feature or use case?
    Who is it for?
    What is the context in which it is used and are there any prerequisites/requirements?
    What can the audience do with this? (Be sure to consider all applicable audiences, like GitHub admin and developer-user.)
    What are the benefits to using this over any alternatives?

##Use cases

Describe some use cases, typically in bulleted form. Include real-life examples for each.

If the page itself is dedicated to a use case, this section can usually include more specific scenarios for use (for example, variations on the main use case), but if that's not applicable, the section can be omitted.

Examples of use cases on feature pages:

    CE and EE: Issues
    CE and EE: Merge Requests
    EE-only: Geo
    EE-only: Jenkins integration

##Requirements

State any requirements for using the feature and/or following along with the instructions.

These can include both:

    technical requirements (for example, an account on a third party service, an amount of storage space, prior configuration of another feature)
    prerequisite knowledge (for example, familiarity with certain GitHub features, cloud technologies)

Link each one to an appropriate place for more information.

"Instructions" is usually not the name of the heading.

This is the part of the document where you can include one or more sets of instructions, each to accomplish a specific task.

Headers should describe the task the reader will achieve by following the instructions within, typically starting with a verb.

Larger instruction sets may have subsections covering specific phases of the process. Where appropriate, provide examples of code or configuration files to better clarify intended usage.

    Write a step-by-step guide, with no gaps between the steps.
    Include example code or configurations as part of the relevant step. Use appropriate Markdown to wrap code blocks with syntax highlighting.
    Start with an h2 (##), break complex steps into small steps using subheadings h3 > h4 > h5 > h6. Never skip a hierarchy level, such as h2 > h4, as it will break the TOC and may affect the breadcrumbs.
    Use short and descriptive headings (up to ~50 chars). You can use one single heading like ## Configure X for instructions when the feature is simple and the document is short.

Notes:

    (1): Apply the tier badges accordingly
    (2): Apply the correct format for the [GitHub version that introduces the feature](styleguide.md#github
